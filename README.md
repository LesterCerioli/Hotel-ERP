**What is the intent of this demo?**          
Thereâ€™s never been a better time to be a developer. Our intent with these set of reference apps and Azure backend is to show developers how to get started building the apps of the future, today!

------

**Where is the code for the SmartHotel360 applications?**                         

The entire code for the SmartHotel360 application is maintained on GitHub at https://github.com/microsoft/SmartHotel360. The build and release pipelines in this project are set to point to this repo.

--------
**How can I deploy the application to my subscription?**  
**SmartHotel360** has multiple apps that share a common backend, including a public website where hotel guests can book a room, smart conference rooms, and even verify if their pets are allowed in the hotel. In this demo we are going to build and deploy public website of **SmartHotel360**

Please follow the steps below to deploy the "Public Web" application.

### Build and Deploy SmartHotel360 Public Web

1. Navigate to **Pipelines \| Builds**. Select **SmartHotel_Petchecker-Web** pipeline and click **Edit**.

    You will be prompted to authorize this connection with Azure credentials. Disable pop-up blocker in your browser if you see a blank screen after clicking the OK button, and please retry the step.

   This creates an **Azure Resource Manager Service Endpoint**, which defines and secures a connection to a Microsoft Azure subscription, using Service Principal Authentication (SPA). This endpoint will be used to connect** Azure DevOps** and **Azure**.

   > If your subscription is not listed or to specify an existing service principal, follow the [Service Principal creation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/connect-to-azure?view=vsts) instructions.


1. Update the **Azure Subscription** in all the other tasks and **Save** the changes.

1. Click **Create Release** to trigger the deployment.
